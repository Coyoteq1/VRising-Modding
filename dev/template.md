## Template
We have a mod template to make getting started easy

### Installation
`dotnet new --install VRising.ModTemplate`

### Example usage
`dotnet new vrisingmod -n NameOfYourMod --use-vcf --use-bloodstone --description "Description of your mod"`

This will get you started with a mod named _NameOfYourMod_, using [Bloodstone](./bloodstone.md) and [VampireCommandFramework](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework/) that has a sample server command to uncomment.
