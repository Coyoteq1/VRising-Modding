## Template
We have a mod template to make getting started easy

### Installation
dotnet new --install VRising.ModTemplate

### Example usage
dotnet new vrisingmod -n NameOfYourMod --use-vcf --use-bloodstone --description "Description of your mod"

This will get you started with a mod named _NameOfYourMod_, using [Bloodstone](./bloodstone.md) and [VCF](https://github.com/decaprime/VampireCommandFramework/) that has a sample server command to uncomment.


You can reference [open source](./open source.md) and [resources](./resources.md) for more information for now.
